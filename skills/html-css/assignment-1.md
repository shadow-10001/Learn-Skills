## Instructions

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Create a new HTML file (`index.html`).
   - The page should include:
     - A header with a title for your website (e.g., "My First Web Page").
     - A navigation bar with at least three links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
     - A main section with:
       - A short introduction paragraph about yourself.
       - An image related to your interests.
       - A list of your hobbies or favorite activities (ordered or unordered).
     - A footer with:
       - Your name.
       - The current year.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Create a new CSS file (`styles.css`).
   - Link the CSS file to your HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
   - Apply the following styles:
     - Change the background color of the page to a light shade (e.g., light gray or pastel).
     - Center-align the header text and use a font size of at least 24px.
     - Style the navigation links:
       - Display them horizontally.
       - Add padding and a hover effect (e.g., change color or underline when hovered).
     - Style the main section:
       - Add a border and some padding around the introduction paragraph.
       - Center the image and give it a max width of 300px.
     - Style the footer:
       - Use a smaller font size and center-align the text.
